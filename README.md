# Kobo Screenshot Uploader

This is a badly-written script that uploads your screenshots to your Telegram Bot.

This script **NEEDS**  [NickelMenu](https://github.com/pgaskin/NickelMenu) to work.

1. Extract the [zip](https://github.com/luke-gto/kobo-screenshot-uploader/releases/) zip to the **root** folder of your Kobo

2. Create a Telegram bot with [Bot Father](https://t.me/BotFather).

3. Copy and paste  the TOKEN in 

      ```http://localhost:8888/callback/```

4. Copy and paste your Telegram Chat ID (you can ) in 

      ```http://localhost:8888/callback/```

5. Open the NickelMenu and you should see the "send_screenshot" option. Tap on it in order to send your screenshots. Remember to have an internet connection ;)
